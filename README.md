# MilkQuest3
Milk Quest 3 is the worst platforming game in existance, and now it's coming towards YOUR local git repository!

If you're looking for the current """stable""" build, you can get it here:
https://stevethebartender.itch.io/milk-quest

You'll need GMS2 to build the game (the demo works fine as long as you aren't trying to export to .exe)

idk what else to put here besides the code sucks right now and i would not reccomend using it as a base for your projects
